# Mental Health Chatbot

## Project Description

Mental health is a vital aspect of overall well-being, yet many individuals face barriers in accessing the support they need. 

Introducing Chitti, the mental health assistant that makes you feel better!

Chitti is a chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing techniques that understands users' problems and generates a response accordingly. It is built using a `Flask` backend, `NLTK`, `Tensorflow`, and `Keras` for model training, and `JavaScript` for frontend.
